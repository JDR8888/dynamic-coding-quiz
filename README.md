# Description
A two-page dynamic API quiz. Interact with the page to initiate a timed quiz that is dynamically generated onto the page via javascript - get a question wrong and watch the timer plummet 10 seconds! think you have what it takes to finish the quiz before the timer reaches 0 to get your score logged in the top 10? You can easily navigate to the scoreboard page with a consistent theme, that utilizes the power of local storage to remember your scores when you revisit the page if you've made the top ten list. 
This project was made completely from scratch utilizing knowledge learned in Columbia University's fullstack bootcamp. The project was put together with the following acceptance criteria:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
