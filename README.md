# Description
A two-page dynamic API quiz. Interact with the page to initiate a timed quiz that is dynamically generated onto the page via javascript - get a question wrong and watch the timer plummet 10 seconds! think you have what it takes to finish the quiz before the timer reaches 0 to get your score logged in the top 10? You can easily navigate to the scoreboard page with a consistent theme, that utilizes the power of local storage to remember your scores when you revisit the page if you've made the top ten list. 

The deployed page is: https://jdr8888.github.io/dynamic-coding-quiz
The github repo is https://github.com/JDR8888/dynamic-coding-quiz
